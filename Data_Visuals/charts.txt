Based on the features you've provided, here are five chart ideas for a dashboard that effectively tell a story about the data without using a map:

1. Line Chart: Trips and Spending Over Time

This chart would plot total trips and total spending (spendSAR) on a dual-axis over month and year. It's a fundamental chart for identifying seasonal trends and long-term growth or decline. You can quickly see if travel volume and spending are correlated and observe how they change throughout the year.

2. Bar Chart: Top Destination Provinces by Total Trips

This simple yet effective bar chart would rank the destinationProvinceNameEn by the total number of trips. It's a quick way to show which provinces are the most popular travel destinations. Sorting the bars from highest to lowest would immediately highlight the top performers and the least visited areas.

3. Scatter Plot: Spending vs. Nights

This chart would show the relationship between spendSAR and nights. Each point on the plot would represent a trip, and you could observe if longer trips (nights) tend to result in higher spending. You could add another layer of analysis by color-coding the points by visitPurposeEn to see if the relationship between spending and duration varies for business versus leisure travel.

4. Trip Flow Matrix: Trip Flow from Origin to Destination

A heatmap is an excellent way to visualize the travel corridors between provinces. You could have originProvinceNameEn on one axis and destinationProvinceNameEn on the other. The color intensity of each cell would represent the number of trips between that specific origin-destination pair. This gives a powerful, at-a-glance view of the major travel routes without needing a geographical map.

5. Dual-Axis Chart: Trips and Average Temperature by Month

This chart would directly link travel volume to climate. A bar chart would represent the total trips for each month, and an overlaid line chart would show the average destination_temp for that same period. This allows you to easily see if peaks in travel align with certain temperatures, directly utilizing the temperature data to explain seasonal travel behavior.
